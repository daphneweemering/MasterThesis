## What is the project about?
For this master thesis project, I am investigating the usefulness of interim sample size reestimation for combined N-of-1 trials, under the supervision of Peter van de Ven at the UMC Utrecht. Combined N-of-1 trials recently gained interest for studying the effectiveness of interventions in rare diseases. Rare diseases pose a major challenge for the identification of effective treatments as conventional randomized controlled trials generally require a infeasible number of subjects. Combining separate N-of-1 trials allows for estimation of the population treatment effect. The number of trials necessary is determined beforehand by means of sample size calculations. These calculations are particularly challenging because relevant parameters are generally unknown at the design stage of a study. 

With this master thesis project, I investigate the incorporation of interim sample size reestimation in series of N-of 1 trials. Simulation studies are used to assess to what extent the misspecification of each of the unknown parameters affects the required sample size, power and type I error rate in a series of N-of-1 trials.

## What is in this repository?
The repository contains the following folders/files:
- documentation: Includes the manuscript (as .pdf and .Rmd file) and other files that support the manuscript.
- functions: Contains the functions to simulate series of N-of-1 trials (with and without the process of interim sample size reestimation) and estimates the power/type I error rate.
- output: This folder contains the output/results from the simulation studies for the power and type I error rate under the reestimation approach and the power under a fixed sample size approach. This folder also includes versions of the output that is modified in order to make it suitable for plotting figures. 
- proposal: Includes the proposal for the thesis project. 
- research report: Includes the scripts and other documents for the research report, an interim product of the master thesis project. 
- simulations: Includes the scripts for the simulation settings for the different simulation studies. 
- requirements: A document that describes the packages, software and dependencies necessary for running the scripts.
