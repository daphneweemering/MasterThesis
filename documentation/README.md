## Documentation of project

The different folders include the documentation of the different stages of the master thesis project. The project starts of with a proposal (see 'Proposal), which includes a relatively short summary of what the project's is going to look like. The proposal is followed by the research report, which is an interim product of the thesis. This interim product should have one of the following formats: a mini-thesis (short intro, methods and results section) or the first half of the final product (finished intro and methods section). For this report the mini-thesis format is chosen. 

For the documentation of all stages of the project, both a .tex file and a .bib are distributed.
