## Figures and graphs

This folder is, like the other folders, split up in different folders. Each folder represents a different stage of the project. For now, only the figure(s) for the research report are available. This includes a boxplot with nine scenarios of hypothesized parameter settings, with the data being under the true model \psi^2 = 2 and \sigma^2 = 1. The purpose of this figure is to show the way that the sample size changes under different hypothesized values. Both the mean and the median are shown in the boxplot.
